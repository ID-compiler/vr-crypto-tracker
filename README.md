## ‚è± Trigger Setup

- **Event Source**: Time-driven
- **Type**: Every 30 minutes

##  Rate Limit Handling

- CoinGecko free API is limited (may return HTTP 429)
- To avoid this:
  - Don‚Äôt run too frequently
  - Add retry logic or use a paid API key

- `README.md` ‚Äî project documentation
- `trigger.png` ‚Äî trigger setup screenshot
- `email-success.png` ‚Äî email notification proof
